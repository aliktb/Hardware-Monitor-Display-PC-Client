## Hardware Monitor Display - Pi

Read CPU and GPU temperature readings, then display them as a set of gauges on an external display.



-----

### Requirements

1. Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 with latest update
2. Windows 10 (admin account) with .Net Framework 4.6.2
3. Raspberry Pi (tested with model 3B+ but should work with any variant) with Micro SD card and monitor
4. ethernet cable and optional USB to ethernet dongle if no spare ethernet is available on PC


### Usage

1. Download a fresh copy of Raspbian and install to micro SD (any Pi) or USB (only works on Pi 4)
2. Configure static IP as 190.160.1.5 (not like the common subnet of 192.168.xxx.xxx)
3. Place python files in a new directory in the user's home directory eg. Documents, Downloads etc.
4. Append the following line at the end of the file:
    @/usr/bin/python3 /home/USER/DIRECTORY_OF_PYTHON_FILES/main.py
5. Connect Pi to PC via ethernet cable. Can be done with PC motherboard's LAN input or USB to ethernet dongle
6. Connect monitor to Pi vid HDMI. (Currently works with resolution of 1280 x 720)
7. Restart the Pi
